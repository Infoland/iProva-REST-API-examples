# Bulk exports
This is an example how to download a bulk export using C# code.

Our services team created a tool to automatically download bulk exports in a user friendly way. This tool used to be released and managed in this repository, but was moved to its own repo over [here](https://github.com/Infoland/BulkExportDownload).
